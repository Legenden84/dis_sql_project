* Search: Here, the user can type in a phrase to search for.
* Search Options: Here, the user can select which category to search for in the database. The user can search either by title or by year. A search by title will find both video games and movies with titles containing the search word. A search by year will return all video games and movies released within that year.
* *Popular Video Games 1980 - 2023, and movie adaptations* and *Film Adaptations of Video Games* are not part of the query. They are simply two dataframes representing each table in our database. The user can see what to search for.
